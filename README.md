## Overview
### Description
GoodHearted is an app that users can press one button for emergency call when help is needed. Users who are on a userâ€™s emergency contact list will be notified; as well as app users who are nearby will be notified.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Utilities
- **Mobile:** Mobile App (iOS only) for now. However, this app can be expanded to Android users as well.
- **Story:** People in distress can seek immediate help by clicking the Emergency button and notify nearby users and emergency contacts (friends and family). They can also use the map feature to locate other users in the same location and come help others if needed.
- **Market:** It is designed for all people who seek help when they feel unsafe in public or even at their own home. People from minority groups may find this app helpful, especially during this tough time.
- **Habit:** This app can be used whenever a person feels that they are in danger. For those who go to school/work or run errands on a daily basis, this app can be used regularly as well.
- **Scope:** This app can send notifications to people nearby who are in the vicinity of the threat and also use GPS to notify the friends and family of the user's location.
